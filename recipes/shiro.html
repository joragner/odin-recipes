    <img src="./images/shiro-wat.jpg" alt="shiro wot">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> 
        <strong>Shiro Wot </strong> is a staple vegetarian dish (actually it’s vegetarian and gluten-free!) in Ethiopian cuisine. 
        It’s a stew or curry made from ground dried chickpeas and various spices.
        This richly spiced and thick soup is amazingly delicious. It is also incredibly easy to make using whatever spices you have in your pantry.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium onions</li>
        <li>1 tomato</li>
        <li>1/2 cup oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shiro powder</li>
        <li>water (1-1/2 to 2 cups)</li>
        <li>lots of berbere</li>    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a heavy bottom stockpot to medium heat. 
            Add pureed onions to the dry pan, and saute until they become dry and start to take on color- about 4-5 minutes. Add the oil and berbere spice.
             Saute for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next add tomato and chopped garlic. Saute for 2-3 minutes more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now start whisking in about half of the chickpea flour.
             Gradually start to add about 1 cup of water.
              Whisk in the remaining chickpea flour and an additional 1 cup of water. 
              Whisk until mixture is very smooth. 
            Add remaining ½ cup of water if you prefer your shiro a little thinner.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat until the shiro begins to pop (simmer). 
            Then add the niter kibbeh, garlic powder, sugar,
             and salt to taste, stirring until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Simmer for about 5-10 minutes over low heat until the flavors combine and the oil separates slightly from the shiro.
        </li>
        <li>
            Garnish with jalepeno, if desired.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve with fresh injera.
        </li>
    </ol>
