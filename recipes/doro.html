    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups water, divided</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>¾ cup berbere seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped garlic</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sweet white wine</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 hard-boiled eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Soak the chicken in 2 cups water and lemon juice in a large bowl for 10 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the onion, with no fat, in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high heat.
             Cook and stir until very dark, about 20 minutes. Stir in the butter, cayenne pepper, paprika, black pepper, and ginger, then stir in 1 more cup of water. 
             Add the drained chicken, stirring until well-blended. Cover and reduce heat to low. 
             Simmer until the chicken is tender, about 1 hour. 
             If a thicker stew is desired, whisk flour with 2 tablespoons of water, and stir into the pot; 
             allow to simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes.
             Stir in eggs; cook and stir until heated through, about 10 minutes more.
